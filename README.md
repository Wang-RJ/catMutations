# catMutations

### Reproducing figures in our study of mutations in 11 trios of the domestic cat

Dependencies: **dplyr**, **ggplot2**, **binom**\
Tested to be compatible with R version 4.0.2

In addition to the supplemental file **denovo_table.txt**, which lists our set of 233 de novo mutations in the manuscript, **prepare_plots.R** will read accompanying data from the **tables/** subdirectory.\
**plots.R** reproduces the plots found in Figures 2 and 3 from the main text and Figures S1 and S3 from the Supplementary Material.
