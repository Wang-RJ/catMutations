The following tables in this directory are used to help build plots using data from the cat mutation study:

decode_DNMs.tsv
Publicly available human mutation data from JÃ³nsson et al. (2017; doi: 10.1038/nature24018)

decode_Ctriplet_seq.txt
Nucleotide triplets surrounding each de novo site from above study, queried from the human reference genome. Used to look for CpG sites.

dncGQ70_seq.txt
Nucleotide triplets surrounding each de novo site from our cat mutation study, queried from the cat reference genome.

DOB.txt
Birth dates of individuals in the cat pedigrees.

het_callabilityGQ70.table
Heterozygote callability calculated from sampling at GQ threshold of 70, see Methods in main text.

hom_callabilityGQ70.table
Homozygote callability calculated from sampling at GQ threshold of 70, see Methods in main text.

samtools_depth.table
Number of sites on each chromosome of the cat genome that pass the depth filter, calculated with samtools depth.

trio_tableMFC.csv
Table listing proband ID for Mother, Father, and Child for each trio.
